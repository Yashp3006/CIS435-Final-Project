## 🗂️ Project Structure

### 🔹 Part 1: Classification
- ✅ Implemented **1R Algorithm** on Balloons and Mysterious datasets  
- ✅ Applied **K-Nearest Neighbors (K=1)** on Iris and Mysterious datasets  
- 📈 Achieved **93.3% accuracy** on Iris dataset using KNN  
- 🔍 Extracted rule-based classifiers with 1R, achieving high accuracy and low error

### 🔹 Part 2: Clustering
- ✅ Built **Bisecting K-Means** model and evaluated cluster **purity** on Iris dataset  
- 🌐 **Bonus Task:** Detected **core users** in the BlogCatalog social network using **NetworkX**
